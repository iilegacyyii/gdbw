Every piece of gdbw is designed to be customizable, the UI, prompt, commands and all libraries the commands use are all implemented in lua (check out `/plugins`).

## Installation

Wiki coming soon, GitHub won't let me make a wiki for a private repository...

## Contributing

Both pull requests and feedback are welcome! Once this is a little more fleshed out we plan on having a proper contribution format.
